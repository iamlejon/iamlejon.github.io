Coding is extremely cool right?  But, let's be real, it can also be extremely frustrating especially when learning. 

While learning the Object Orientation portion of Ruby, I found myself becoming extremely stressed out as we moved from one lab to the next and I found myself asking questions like.. but when did we learn this?  Are we supposed to know this?  AM I THE ONLY ONE WHO DIDN'T UNDERSTAND THAT?

And those types of questions eventually start to weigh you down and slow down your progress.  My velocity went from 100 to like 30, and that was the most discouraging part for me.

**You wanna hear something funny?**

I actually googled, "are you supposed to remember every single thing from bootcamp"?  Haha it sounds funny right?? It wasn't.  (at the time, now hilarious).

But what was most surprising is the answers that people actually took the time to write.   One person said something that really stuck with me, he said I've been programming for years now and there are days I still feel like I don't know what I'm doing.  

That seemed to be a common consensus..is that as a programmer, you don't know EVERYTHING.  You definitely don't remember everything.  But what you do have is a foundation to start from and the knowledge of where to go to find solutions, get help, or study a remedy so that you can implement your own. 

Coding is not proprietary, it is a community made up of individual knowledge that we push to each other, and when we're stuck or can't recall, there are guides, ruby-docs, slacks, github, and GOOGLE, for a reason.

Avi said something too during one of his videos, every so often he would stop because I think people's faces or lack of response would be like ------------------....----------------- and he reminded us that when we see him coding fast and pulling concepts out of there air that are foreign to us, that he's been doing this for a LONG time.  That he's taught this lesson over, and over, and over many many times and that it wasn't instant for him. 

Most great things take practice, and they take time.  Michael Jordan didn't become one of the world's greatest basketball players overnight.  It took practice, it took time, but most of all it took failure and him learning to use his failures as fuels to success.  

A failed attempt is just an option you can cross of the list, there are many possibilities. 

This really helped put things back and to perspective for me and reminded me it's a sprint, not a race.  Then I went back and took my time to understand what I was learning, rather than just learn it.
