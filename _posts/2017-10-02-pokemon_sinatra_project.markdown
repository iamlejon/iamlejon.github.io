# sinatra-project

For my Sinatra project I started to do a very basic teacher/student classroom manage project but thought to myself.. that's kind of boring and wanted to do something that was more engaging.

For this project I used HTML, CSS, Ruby, and ActiveRecord and Sinatra.
There are also various pieces of Javascript used in certain portions of the project to provide on-click functionality for some objects.

How it works?
To start, begin by signing up.  
You will need to choose a name, a unique username, and a password.
If your username is taken by another user, you will be directed back to the sign-in screen with a
red message indicating the username is already chosen.

You will also need to choose a photo from the selection provide.


User's homepage
You will be brought to your unique homepage where you will see your picture
and your bio.  Initially your bio will be empty, you will need to edit bio to update it.

You may also choose to catch a new pokemon to add to your inventory.

You may rename the pokemon or release it if you feel the it is better off in the wild.


**THIS PROJECT WAS THE MOST**
I spent a lot of time on this project and in doing so it really helped me to understand a lot of concepts better including Routes, Has to/Belongs to relationships, CSS, and Javascript.  

I learned that web design is not just one language or one THING, but it's a bunch of moving pieces and languages that come together to create the end product from the front-end, to the back-end, and everything in between.

All in all this was my favorite project so far and I really feel like I gained a better aspect to how powerful Ruby is.  Since this is using Sinatra, it makes me more excited to start learning Rails as I'm sure the magic is only going to get grander.
