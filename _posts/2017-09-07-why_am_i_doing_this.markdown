Why am I doing this?  - Probably one of the most important questions I have asked myself in my lifetime and ESPECIALLY in my career.

Like many coders as I've come to find out, I started learning to code when I was pretty young, maybe around 12-13 years old.  I enjoyed creating fansites about celebrities or anime sites.
At this point, Dial-Up internet was still a thing, cell phone's still flipped, Michael Jackson was still moonwalking, and Britney hadn't yet shaved her head.

Coding was something I was very passionate about, I created my own layouts with photoshop and learned to code them using DIV layers by studying other people's templates.  Eventually I became really really good at it (for a teenager), but I never thought it was something I could do as a career.

When it was time to entire college, I wasn't sure what I wanted to do but I knew i liked Business and I liked Technology so I majored in Management of Information Systems.

This was about maybe 4 years agot today.  My career track so far has included IT Support, Jr. Business Analyst, Sr. Data Researcher, and Implementation Project Manager, but to be truthful, none of those roles fulfilled me.  I felt the most fulfilled at work when I was solving extremely complicated business problems using code.  

When I worked for S&P we had an in-house proprietary language called PLREP that I used to code everything and I learned it inside and out until suddenly I was the best in the US region, and one of the best through our 3 regions (Houston, Singapore, London).  

I became weighed down with many projects and found excitement finishing them, working with end-users to gather their requirements, and coding solutions to the problems they had expressed verbally or written.  

I knew in my current role their was going to be some changes in the company and my role would be focused less on coding as we prepared to move to a system that took a lot of our day to day work away, particularly the coding part.  But.. it's what I enjoyed.

So I took the opportunity after a couple of years, to grow towards that direction.  I first I felt overwhelmed because theres so many languages, and SO much I don't know.  But what I'm learning is, the syntax is different, but the concepts are similar and I am again excited about my future.
