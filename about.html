<p>This blog chronicles my amazing (often confusing) adventures as a challenge myself to complete the Full Stack Web Development program at FlatIron.   I graduated with my degree in MIS (Management of Information Systems) and learned the basics of coding (I know learning the basics in college? Seems backwards).  And quickly realized as the years have gone by that EVERYTHING's changed.  Time to change with it.</p>
