For my CLI Data GEM Project, I thought to myself okay what am I always looking up?  And within .02 seconds I said easy, shoes. 

I am a sneaker head.  I love shoes I wear bright red Nikes just so people know that this is not a drill.  This is life.   

(which is why I need to become a developer to support this addiction before I'm homeless)


For this project we will be pulling to BEST SELLING Men's and Women's Nike products & prices from the NIKE.COM website.  I decided to add an additional layer by not only including the top sellers list, but giving the user the option to sort it by Running Shoes, Lifestyle shoes (me), or Basketball shoes.


Once they access these menus, they will have the ability to exit or "Cancel" out of these screens to return to the main screen, or choose new categories, or even decide to browse the other gender's selection. 

If they are done entirely with the experience, we thank them for their time and remind them of our motto.


I feel like this project actually made me love Ruby a little more and gave me a better understanding of what I was doing and why.  Writing my own program vs doing a lab, gave me the control to mentally envision what I wanted to create and the foundation from the labs gave me the resources to do it.

I feel like it helped me better understand topics that were before a little blurry, now I got to really see why I needed to do xyz or what the importance of etc was in relation to what I was doing.

Definitely probably my favorite project that I've done so far within this course.
